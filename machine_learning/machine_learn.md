- Getting machines to do things without saying 'do this, do that'

- Machine Learning expert and Data Scientist are often the same

## Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement

- Supervised: classification and prediction based on testing

- Unsupervised: a csv without headings...the machine groups things without preset classifications

- Reinforcement: teaching machines through trial and error. Maximize a game score through skill acquisition
